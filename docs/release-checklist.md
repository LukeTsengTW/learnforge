# Release checklist

## v1.2.0 frontend cutover

Current public production frontend: [https://luketsengtw.github.io/learnforge/](https://luketsengtw.github.io/learnforge/). Current production backend is Supabase `learnforge-demo`, ref `mrrssxqolvcjxgqzoeqt`, Tokyo. The old “linked development project” label for this ref is historical; the public frontend uses this production backend.

Production already has migration `20260928143200_ai_grading_v3_submission` and `submit-quiz` version 2 (ACTIVE, `verify_jwt=false`). The v1.2 frontend must be deployed before authenticated v3 smoke because v1.1.1 expects the `semantic-fill-v2` response contract. The prior public frontend recovery point is v1.1.1 commit `5608fdad6b9ec01d5aabe9fd28ec9f2cbd834894`, Pages run `36427515831`; the previous known `submit-quiz` revision is version 1.

Cutover sequence:

1. Verify compatibility, bump public version metadata, update delivery documentation, and pass the local release gates.
2. Commit and push the exact v1.2 release tree.
3. Dispatch `Deploy LearnForge to GitHub Pages` on `master`; verify its head SHA, build and deploy jobs, and deployed v1.2.0 artifact using the production Supabase ref.
4. Run the authenticated production smoke as the user: calculation, drawing, erased-drawing system unanswered, quota isolation and idempotency replay. This release checklist does not claim those checks passed until their live evidence is recorded.
5. Stop after frontend deployment for user smoke. Create the v1.2.0 tag and GitHub Release only after the authenticated smoke passes.

See [v1.2 delivery notes](v1.2-delivery.md) for the product contract and release lineage.

## Historical v1.0 release checklist

The following records the v1.0 release gate as it stood on 2026-09-27; its status and pre-release assumptions do not describe the current v1.2 production state.

Status on 2026-09-27: **READY FOR PUBLIC DEPLOYMENT** after the Final Release Gate. No Git commit, push, Pages deploy or tag has been performed; the public URL remains 404 until deployment.

## Verified in the v1.0 workspace and linked project at that time

- [x] Node 24.21.0 / npm 11.19.0; package version 1.0.0.
- [x] Baseline 320 tests passed before implementation; final 353 tests / 42 files passed.
- [x] Lint, TypeScript/production build, quiz validation and AI context checks passed.
- [x] `npm audit --json` and `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: zero vulnerabilities; no dependency upgrade.
- [x] Two additive migrations applied after list, inspection, rollback fixture and dry run; all 12 linked/local migrations aligned.
- [x] Generated public types rechecked; full security SQL passed with rollback.
- [x] New `account-recovery-code` / `recover-account` Edge functions ACTIVE with platform `verify_jwt=false`; Deno checks passed.
- [x] Dedicated-account recovery, replay denial, old/new password login, session binding and current-password policy verified live.
- [x] Temporary `RECOVERY_ALLOW_NO_CAPTCHA` removed; public recovery fails closed again.
- [x] Auth signup/email enabled, confirm-email off for synthetic addresses, password minimum 8, require-current-password on.
- [x] Final Gate used real Turnstile: missing/invalid CAPTCHA signup and recovery denied; positive signup, login and full recovery passed in Chrome.
- [x] Wrong recovery code and used-code replay denied; old password login denied and new password login succeeded.
- [x] Temporary localhost widget/Edge allowlist entries removed; production hostname only, bypass absent.
- [x] Security advisors: 0 ERROR / 1 WARN; event-trigger grant warnings removed while RLS automation still works.
- [x] Remaining leaked-password warning explained: organization is Free; protection not available on current plan.
- [x] Production `/learnforge/` build tested in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit; core routes and HashRouter reload passed.
- [x] Live shared-tab/independent-context sync, simultaneous submit race, offline reconnect and recovery backup checks passed.
- [x] 360 / 768 / 1440 widths checked for Account, password recovery, practice recovery, Result and Analytics; screenshots reviewed.
- [x] Form labels, focus and keyboard smoke checked; existing accessibility-oriented tests passed. No WCAG certification claimed.
- [x] Source and production secret scan clean; external `_blank` links have `noopener noreferrer`; no `unsafe-eval`.
- [x] Test accounts enumerated with counts and retained; OpenAI calls for v1.0: 0.
- [x] README, CHANGELOG, SECURITY, privacy and delivery documents prepared.

## Required before any public deployment

- [x] Real Cloudflare Turnstile widget restricted to `luketsengtw.github.io`; no test key or localhost hostname remains.
- [x] `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` included in the production frontend build; Supabase Auth CAPTCHA and Edge `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` configured.
- [x] Edge `TURNSTILE_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES` matches the exact production hostname; development bypass absent.
- [x] Native Auth CAPTCHA enabled; real signup/login and custom recovery success plus missing/invalid token rejection verified.
- [x] GitHub Actions public variables `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` present.
- [x] GitHub Pages source set to GitHub Actions. The site remains 404 before deployment; use `configure-pages` output for the actual base path.
- [x] Auth Site URL and additional redirect set to `https://luketsengtw.github.io/learnforge/`. Do not push the whole local `config.toml` over unrelated remote settings.
- [x] Project identity reconciled during v1.2 M5A: `learnforge-demo` / `mrrssxqolvcjxgqzoeqt` is the backend used by the public Pages bundle; no separate release project was selected.
- [ ] Obtain explicit authorization for commit, push and Pages deployment. None of those actions happened in this Final Gate.
- [ ] After deployment, run a smoke against the actual Pages URL: login, protected route reload, submit/result, history, account and real CAPTCHA recovery. Local preview does not establish real Pages hosting behavior.
- [ ] Decide whether to remove the enumerated test accounts; deletion requires separate explicit authorization and review of cascade effects.

## Reproducible local verification

```sh
node --version
npm --version
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run check:quizzes
npm run check:ai-context
npm run build -- --base=/learnforge/
npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173 --strictPort --base /learnforge/
npm audit --json
npm audit --omit=dev --json
```

Run the optional `scripts/release-browser-e2e.mjs` with `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_DIR` pointing to an installed `node_modules` containing Playwright and `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` pointing to its matching installed browsers. It uses the production preview and creates a dedicated `lfv10ui_` account; it deliberately does not delete it. No auth storage state, trace or raw recovery secret is saved. Do not run it against production without authorization.

`scripts/release-recovery-e2e.mjs` requires the expressly authorized temporary development CAPTCHA exception when real credentials are absent. It uses a dedicated `lfv10rc_` account and removes the exception in `finally`. Inspect the removal result even if a test fails. It also verifies fail-closed behavior after removal. Do not leave a bypass enabled if the process is interrupted.

```sh
npx supabase migration list --linked
npx supabase db push --linked --dry-run --skip-vault
npx supabase gen types typescript --linked --schema public
npx supabase db query --linked --file supabase/tests/security.sql
npx supabase db advisors --linked --type security --fail-on error
deno check --no-lock --node-modules-dir=none supabase/functions/account-recovery-code/index.ts supabase/functions/recover-account/index.ts
git diff --check
```

## Rollback and incident notes

Do not reset, truncate or repair linked migration history. Keep the recovery tables and applied migrations. For an incident, first disable the custom recovery endpoint or make it return a fixed unavailable response, remove any bypass, and stop new claims. Investigate the claim/used state before retrying an ambiguous reset. Never manually resurrect a consumed code. Existing five-minute claims can expire, while the database fence rejects delayed invalid Auth writes.

Database rollback must be an inspected additive migration and retain the fence until no pending recovery writes can commit. Reverting only the first migration's trigger would reintroduce the confirmed Auth multi-statement failure. Re-deploy a reviewed previous Edge revision only after checking schema compatibility; do not regrant browser EXECUTE on the event-trigger function. Restore Auth policy only to an equally strong documented setting.

After a future Pages deployment, frontend rollback can redeploy a prior reviewed artifact; current work has no public artifact to roll back. GitHub Pages cannot provide arbitrary response security headers; its meta CSP is a partial protection. Keep the one-hour JWT acceptance window, server-only advisor INFO messages, localStorage risks and whole-attempt conflict policy visible in release notes.
